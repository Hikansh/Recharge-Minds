                      Covid 19 : For Better or For Worse – It’s about Your
                      Perspective
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      The emotional impact that novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has
                      bought, is being dealt at individual levels; with each one
                      of us experiencing a range of emotions. While there is
                      undoubtedly an increase in anxiety and stress; people are
                      also becoming more aware of their mental and emotional
                      wellbeing. While we are reflecting on the negative impact
                      of this disease, we are also hoping for a cure soon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Well, 2020 has been a year no one anticipated at all. As
                      we come to realize that ‘life’ as we knew, will not be the
                      same; the year 2020 has also made us understand what truly
                      is essential for us to be happy. It’s the moments spend
                      with the family, listening to the stillness and embracing
                      the change; no matter how hard we find it in the
                      beginning. It’s looking forward to taking that walk around
                      the block, going out only to put out the bin or shop for
                      household essentials, keeping a check on maintaining that
                      distance and merely hoping for the normality of it all to
                      begin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We may all be worried about our loved ones, especially
                      those who are vulnerable; but there is also a lot of
                      frustration and eagerness to do the ‘Normal’ at the
                      soonest. The lockdown hasn’t been a comfortable
                      experience, yet we cannot ignore the significant positive
                      side of it. Yes, novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has
                      increased anxiety and stress, and it is easy to feel
                      despair; but it has made us more resilient than we ever
                      thought we could be. Here are some of the most positive
                      impact of this global pandemic:
                    </p>
                    <b>Work-Life Balance</b>
                    <p>
                      We have found exciting ways to work from home. Even though
                      we sometimes juggle with too many online meetings; the
                      work-life balance has never been so flexible! What was
                      once considered unprofessional is now quite common and
                      accepted. People are indeed becoming more tolerant and
                      patient. Just hoping this positive change continues once
                      the workplace opens back.
                    </p>

                    <b> Massive Transformation in Education</b>
                    <p>
                      With online classes, self-led learning, and so much more,
                      home-schooling has been crazy. But; the kids too are
                      learning the virtual way of education and are now much
                      more comfortable and confident in handling their daily
                      tasks as compared to the initial struggle with online
                      learning techniques. Photo by Julia M Cameron from Pexels
                      PIC 3 As parents, we too were given a rare chance to
                      support our kids with their school online learning, and I
                      feel both of us have adapted well and learnt so much more
                      than we could in normal circumstances. Now we know how
                      much kids are doing at school! Our respect for teachers
                      too has grown in leaps. God bless them!
                    </p>
                    <b>Better Sense of Community and Connectedness</b>
                    <p>
                      Even though, covid-19 has restricted our travels or
                      meeting with our loved ones; never have we felt more
                      concerned and connected with friends and family. People
                      across communities are coming forward to support those in
                      need of food, healthcare or necessities. There’s a sense
                      of community belonging and companies too are donating
                      towards affected people and offering support.
                    </p>

                    <b>Innovation in Home-Delivery</b>
                    <p>
                      From a quick takeaway from your favourite local café to
                      ordering those handpicked bottles of wine/beer or getting
                      special food delivery from your favourite place in the
                      city, the venues and businesses are reinventing unique
                      ways to bring their services at your doorstep.
                    </p>

                    <b>Nature has switched its RESET button</b>
                    <p>
                      Even during the darkest of storms, there’s a silver
                      lining. With Covid-19’s setback, our environment has got
                      an opportunity to heal and reset. There is a significant
                      improvement in air quality, and with less traffic on the
                      streets, our pollution levels have also declined. Across
                      the world, people are talking about watching the wildlife
                      coming out in the open, claiming their land and have seen
                      nature thriving in all its glory. Now our learning should
                      be towards innovative ways for clean energy and treating
                      the environment with care.
                    </p>
                    <b>We are More Grateful than Ever</b>
                    <p>
                      Our perspective towards life indeed has changed this past
                      few months, and we surely have more appreciation and
                      gratitude towards everything around us. The sense of being
                      grateful for our freedom, the joy of meeting our loved
                      ones, planning that holiday trip or only going shopping or
                      watching a movie makes us realize how much given up these
                      affect us. As heartbreaking it is to lose people we loved
                      to this global crisis, count your blessings to be
                      resilient enough to come out of these times with
                      gratitude. We are also thankful and grateful for the
                      amazing support of all those at the frontline, the
                      doctors, the nurses and all those who held fort 24/7 for
                      our health & safety. With restrictions in place and
                      routines reduced, we may get a bit frustrated, but this
                      phase too shall pass. Remember, time is constant, and it
                      will change. Covid pandemic may have changed us and our
                      world for now, but that is a positive change. Hopefully,
                      it will make us better humans, empathetic individuals and
                      kinder towards each other.

                        staff move the desks and chairs when cleaning, or do
                        they just clean the tops of the desks? Do they go deeper
                        and also clean the drawers and everything inside of the
